# multiscale

Many thanks for your interest in our work [*Multi-scale fully convolutional neural networks for histopathology image segmentation: from nuclear aberrations to the global tissue architecture.*, Schmitz et al., https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361841521000426]. 

This repository holds the source codes for the proposed model architectures. The sources are free to use under the same license as the original arcticle (provided that the original work is properly attributed, of course).  

We hope that you find our manuscript and these models helpful and an inspiration for your own work. Please feel free to contact the corresponding author in case of questions, or interest in cooperations to further elaborate upon the idea of human-inspired multi-scale FCNs for histopathology and beyond. 

Kind regards, on behalf of the authors, R. Schmitz
